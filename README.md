# rrt_turtlebot
The turtlebot RRT package 


This is a project on known environment exploration using a TurtleBot.
The algorithm used is RRT (rapidly exploring random tree), a popular algorithm
for autonomous robotic planning. The proposed project will have many applications â€“ the robot
can be used for domestic household work, used as a butler and can also be extended to pick
and place objects by adding arms to the turtle bot and use RRT to control the arms.
